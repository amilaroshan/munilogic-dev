                    How we Help New Britain Township
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    New Britain Township is located in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, 35 miles northwest of Philadelphia. The population is 10,698 and the township covers 14.7 square miles. New Britain has 52 miles of township owned roads as well as an additional 20 miles of state owned roads. The township has 32 employees of which 9 are employed in administrative/office positions. Like many suburban Philadelphia communities, New Britain experienced rapid growth beginning in the early 1990’s continuing through the last decade. That growth brought many new residents and began the transformation from a primarily rural area to that of a more traditional suburban community.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Management Issues</h4>
                  <p>Rapid growth put stress on the traditional methods of managing land development, zoning and code enforcement. Increased development increased the volume of paper- work making document management, storage and information retrieval exceedingly difficult and cumbersome. Customer service suffered and important matters sometimes fell between the cracks.</p>
                  <h4>The Munilogic Solution</h4>
                  <p>
                    Munilogic municipal management software provided the solution to the Township’s need to streamline the land development, zoning and code enforcement processes and also provided a 21st century approach to document management.Prior to the installation of the Munilogic system, the Township stored all documents in old fashioned metal filing cabinets. All township maps were stored in file drawers. The simplest inquiry often took a much as 30 minutes to find the information and answer. The Township purchased the Munilogic core system that included the Property module, the communication package (e-mail, calendar, contacts), GIS mapping, reporting, document management and administration. In addition the subdivision, permitting and inspections, roadway, storm sewer, zoning and code enforcement modules were also installed. The implementation was completed in 2008 and the system has been operational for 18 months.

Using the GIS mapping capability, the township maps were converted to computer files that could be quickly accessed by every administrative employee. Details on the history of each property such as permit activity, code violations, zoning variances or changes in ownership were included. An ORTHO (aerial photography) overlay was also added. When the installation was complete, each employee had all the information related to every property in the township at their fingertips. Munilogic personnel trained all township employees in every facet of the program and provided a package of ongoing software updates and technical support.
