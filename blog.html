                  How local governments can gain the trust of the community
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Local governments make a big impact on the constituents in
                  their communities. The decisions they make every day have a
                  big impact on the way people in the community live their
                  lives. Because of this, it is crucial that local governments
                  gain the trust of their constituents. There are many ways for
                  local governments to gain the trust of their community.
                  Increased transparency, actively listening to the community,
                  and being digitally accessible are all great ways to start. In
                  this article, we will take a look at how local governments can
                  gain the trust of their community, and how digital
                  transformation can help increase success.
                </p>
                <h4>Increased Transparency</h4>
                <p>
                  One-way local governments can gain the trust of their
                  constituents is by being transparent in their decision-making
                  process. When constituents can see how decisions are being
                  made, they are more likely to trust that their best interests
                  are being taken into account. There are a few ways to increase
                  transparency. One way is to publish all the meetings of the
                  local government online. This will allow people to see what is
                  being discussed and make it easier for them to provide input.
                  Additionally, local governments can post the agendas for
                  upcoming meetings on their website and on their social media
                  channels so people know what to expect. Posting the meetings
                  online also makes it possible for people who couldnâ€™t make the
                  meeting to stay caught up when they have time. Another way to
                  be transparent is by sharing data with the public. Certain
                  data such as updates on current city projects, data about
                  crime in the community, data about the city budget, and more
                  can be really helpful for constituents. It allows them to see
                  where the community is headed and make informed decisions
                  about their own lives. When data is published online, it makes
                  it accessible to everyone in the community. Being transparent
                  with data also helps show the community that you have nothing
                  to hide, which in turn instills trust.
                </p>
                <h4>Active Listening</h4>
                <p>An important part of gaining trust is being able to listen to the community and take their opinions and concerns seriously. One way to do this is by holding community forums or town halls. This gives community members a chance to voice their concerns and be heard. Additionally, it shows that you are taking the time to listen to what they have to say. Town halls have the benefit of being more personal than more traditional ways of reporting concerns such as surveys or forms. It gives constituents the chance to ask questions and have them answered right away, they could even ask follow-up questions if needed. Town halls can even be done digitally so people who need to stay home can still participate. Digital town halls also give the option of posting the recording to the government website once it is over for people to review or for people who missed it.</p>
                <p>Another way to actively listen to the community is by setting up an online platform where people can submit their ideas for things they would like to see in their community.  This could be anything from a new park to a community event. The government can then take these ideas and work on making them a reality. It would also give the government valuable data about what people in the community really want. For example, if a lot of people submit the suggestion to make a new community park, it is clear that is something that would benefit numerous members of the community.  Setting up online platforms for ideas and feedback shows that the community is being heard and that their ideas are being taken into account.</p>
